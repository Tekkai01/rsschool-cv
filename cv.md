### Profile
Multidisciplinary professional transitioning from art history and auction house expertise to front-end web development. Currently studying at RSS School to master front-end tools and frameworks, and to combine a strong sense of aesthetics with technical skills. I am drawn to front-end development because it offers a unique opportunity to merge creativity and analytical thinking â€” transforming visual ideas into interactive, user-centered experiences.
